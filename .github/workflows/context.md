# Directory Context: .github/workflows

## Purpose

Automation pipelines for CI, releases, and quality checks.

## Key Workflows

- `test.yml`: runs linting and tests on pull requests.
- `publish.yml`: publishes `@asynkron/openagent` to npm whenever a GitHub release is published or manually triggered. Requires `id-token: write` so the `npm publish --provenance` step can request an OIDC token and now skips publication if the version already exists on npm.
- `auto-release.yml`: on every push to `main` (i.e., post-merge), automatically bumps the minor version (using `npm version minor`), tags the release, and creates a GitHub release so that `publish.yml` can push the new version to npm.

## Notes

- Release commits are prefixed with `chore(release):` and are auto-generated by `auto-release.yml`; the workflow skips running against its own commits to avoid infinite loops.
