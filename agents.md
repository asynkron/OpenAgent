# Agent.md

- If no human is present, pick tasks from `todo.md` and work through them sequentially until complete or blocked.
- Before touching unfamiliar code, open the nearest `context.md` (starting from the repo root) to understand the directoryâ€™s purpose, key files, and known risks.
- When you modify code, tests, docs, or prompts, update the relevant `context.md` in that directory (and parent summaries if needed) so the index stays accurate.
