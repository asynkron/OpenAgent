# Directory Context: packages/cli/src/components/command

## Purpose & Scope

- Houses focused helpers that support the `Command` Ink component without crowding the main TSX file.
- Exposes reusable building blocks for plan headings, run previews, theme cloning, summary generation, and command metadata normalisation.

## Key Modules

- `theme.ts` ‚Äî clones the theme-driven styling props for commands so renders can safely mutate local copies.
- `planHeading.ts` ‚Äî normalises the originating plan step into a short heading used inside the command chrome.
- `runPreview.tsx` ‚Äî parses run text, extracts diff segments, and renders either inline or block markdown previews. Tail truncation
  keeps long commands readable while executed command rows still show the leading snippet that shipped with the runtime event.
- `SummaryLine.tsx` ‚Äî renders textual summary rows with theme-aware styling.
- `commandTypes.ts` ‚Äî defines the command payload, execution envelope, and summary line contracts used across the helpers.
- `previewLines.ts` ‚Äî trims stdout/stderr previews into ready-to-render line arrays reused by both Ink and legacy console renderers.
- `renderType.ts`, `detailText.ts` ‚Äî infer the display type for a command and expand execution metadata into human-readable headings.
- `descriptions.ts`, `summaryLines.ts`, `renderData.ts` ‚Äî compute command descriptions, build compact stdout/stderr summaries, and assemble the aggregate render payload consumed by `commandUtils.ts` and the console renderer.

## Notes

- Modules export pure helpers to keep `Command.tsx` focused on layout and data orchestration.
- Shared utilities accept already computed props so tests can inject alternative styles when needed.

## Update: Collapsed Command rows with emoji header (2025-10-19)
- Default collapsed: Command entries show a compact header only.
- Header status emoji (left):
  - üí§ pending (no execution started)
  - ‚è≥ waiting (waitingForId set; also used while streaming if waiting)
  - ‚ñ∂Ô∏è running (started, not done, not waiting)
  - ‚úÖ completed (done)
- Removed UI elements: decorative dots and shell prompt symbol.
- Expanded content shows only:
  - Run preview (block) without shell prompt
  - Output details: observation string and JSON of result (if present)
- Control:
  - Prop expandAll?: boolean (wired from Timeline hotkeys)
  - Hotkeys: e expand all, c collapse all
- Future work (optional): per-command toggle hotkeys and persistent expansion per command.
