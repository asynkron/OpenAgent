# Directory Context: src/agent

## Purpose & Scope

- Implements the agent runtime: conversation loop, OpenAI request orchestration, command execution, plan tracking, and approval flow.

## Key Modules

- `loop.ts` (emits `loop.js`) — orchestrates the event-driven runtime: manages plan snapshots, queues inputs/outputs, handles OpenAI calls, applies filters, coordinates cancellation, and enforces a payload-growth failsafe that dumps runaway histories before retrying. The runtime exposes factory hooks (`createOutputsQueueFn`, `createInputsQueueFn`, `createPlanManagerFn`, `createEscStateFn`, `createPromptCoordinatorFn`, `createApprovalManagerFn`) so hosts can inject alternatives without patching the core loop. Additional DI knobs let callers override logging, request cancellation, prompt phrasing, auto-response limits, and downstream pass executor dependencies.
- `runtimeTypes.ts`, `runtimeEvents.ts`, `runtimeEmitter.ts`, `runtimeFactories.ts`, and `runtimePayloadGuard.ts` collectively pull loop orchestration helpers (shared types, event emission, DI factory wiring, and request-payload safeguards) out of `loop.ts` so the main runtime file stays focused on control flow. `runtimeEvents.ts` now owns the canonical runtime event contracts (including `RuntimeProperty`), keeping the CLI and other consumers aligned with the core definitions while letting `runtimeTypes.ts` import/re-export instead of duplicating shape aliases. The payload guard now records the size of each transmitted request and lets the executor re-baseline after responses so assistant-inflated histories don't trigger the growth failsafe unnecessarily. A dedicated `runtimePayloadFailsafe.ts` module persists diagnostic snapshots and exits early when payloads balloon unexpectedly, keeping the guard itself light while preserving the safety rails.
- `runtimeSharedConstants.ts` hosts the loop-wide constants (auto-response copy, plan reminder text, payload growth factor) shared by the new helper modules and `loop.ts`.
- `runtimeCollaborators.ts` centralizes plan manager, prompt coordinator, and approval manager wiring so `loop.ts` can import a pre-bundled set of collaborators.
- `runtimeMemory.ts` builds the memory policy controller that applies amnesia/dementia filters outside the main control loop.
- `passExecutor.ts` (emits `passExecutor.js`) — coordinates multi-pass reasoning. It requests model completions, parses and validates assistant responses, merges incoming plan data, dispatches shell commands, records observations, nudges the model when plans stall, and syncs plan snapshots back to disk. The helper accepts overridable collaborators for OpenAI calls, command execution, history compaction, observation building, context usage summaries, and schema validation. Supporting utilities live alongside it under `passExecutor/` (plan execution helpers, refusal heuristics) so orchestration logic stays focused on control flow, and a lightweight plan-reminder controller remains for compatibility with older hosts. Recent tightening removed `@ts-nocheck`, aligning the module with typed OpenAI clients and DI hooks so build-time checking now covers its glue code. The orchestration now fans out to dedicated helpers: `passExecutor/assistantResponse.ts` validates model output, `passExecutor/planRuntime.ts` orchestrates plan state, `commandRuntime/` modules gate approvals/execute commands/process results, and `passExecutor/debugEmitter.ts` standardises debug payload emission.
- `passExecutor.ts` now composes dedicated helpers: `passExecutor/executionContext.ts` materializes dependencies, `passExecutor/prePassSequence.ts` runs the payload guard/history compaction/context summary chain, `passExecutor/responseResolution.ts` normalizes assistant responses, and `passExecutor/planExecutor.ts` owns plan iteration and command execution (emitting a dedicated `command-rejected` outcome when a human veto stops a command so the next pass can recover). The plan snapshot helpers (`planExecution.ts`, `planSnapshot.ts`) now operate on explicit DTOs derived from the shared contracts so we can inspect command payloads and observation metadata without falling back to `any`.
- `passExecutor/planReminderController.ts` centralizes the auto-response tracker shim so `passExecutor.ts` interacts with a consistent controller even when hosts omit custom reminder logic.
- `passExecutor/planManagerAdapter.ts` wraps the optional plan manager behind a typed adapter, giving the executor a predictable API for plan merging, resets, and persistence even when hosts only partially implement the contract.
- `passExecutor/planRuntime/noExecutableMessage.ts`, `planIdleStatus.ts`, and `noExecutableOutcomes.ts` split the idle-plan heuristics (message normalization, persistence resets, refusal/pending outcomes) so `noExecutableHandler.ts` can stay focused on composing effects while `idleHandlers.ts` re-exports the public surface.
- `passExecutor/planRuntime/noExecutableHandler.ts` now hosts the no-executable flow, returning effect lists while `idleHandlers.ts` re-exports the surface for compatibility.
- `passExecutor/planRuntime/idleHandlers.ts` now routes message normalization and plan status checks through focused helpers so refusal handling and reminder resets stay linear.
- `approvalManager.ts` (emits `approvalManager.js`) — normalizes the approval policy: checks allowlists/session approvals, optionally prompts the human, and records session grants. The module now consumes the shared `CommandDraft` contract so integrations receive typed hooks for allowlist/session evaluation.
- `amnesiaManager.ts` (emits `amnesiaManager.js`) — prunes stale history entries and exposes a dementia policy helper that drops messages older than the configured pass threshold. The helper now operates on structured `ChatMessageEntry` data and rewrites JSON payloads without relying on untyped records.
- `commandExecution.ts` (emits `commandExecution.js`) and `commands/ExecuteCommand.ts` — normalize assistant command payloads and delegate to the injected shell runner.
- `escState.ts` (emits `escState.js`) — tracks ESC-triggered cancellations and lets consumers await the next cancellation event using a typed payload (`string` or `{ reason: string }`).
- `observationBuilder.ts` (emits `observationBuilder.js`) — formats command results into preview payloads and observation envelopes while guarding against oversized outputs. It now enforces a 200-line default cap (with optional `command.tail_lines` overrides), honours the required `command.max_bytes` limit (default 16 KiB per command), annotates truncated output with explicit notices for the model, and returns discriminated observation DTOs so downstream history helpers receive typed stdout/stderr vs. cancellation payloads. Both defaults are sourced from `../constants.ts` so schemas and runtime stay aligned, and it consumes the shared `CommandResult` DTO exported from `../commands/run.ts` to stay synchronized with the executor.
- `modelRequest.ts` (emits `modelRequest.js`) — wraps the AI SDK responses client with ESC cancellation support, registers the in-flight promise with the ESC state so triggers can abort it immediately, and emits cancellation observations when humans abort requests.
- `structuredResponseEventEmitter.ts` — normalizes streamed message partials from the AI SDK, emits incremental plan snapshots for UI rendering, and only commits the final snapshot once the complete response arrives so command execution remains deferred. The emitter tracks whether a message has already been published so the final response does not resend the last streamed assistant message.
- `historyEntry.ts`, `historyCompactor.ts`, and `runtimePayloadGuard.ts` normalize chat history into the AI SDK message shape so downstream helpers stay provider-agnostic. `historyEntry.ts` now stores `role`/`content` exclusively inside the nested payload (with non-enumerable accessors for callers) and relies on the shared chat-history contract in `src/contracts`, eliminating the duplicated fields that previously bloated history snapshots.
- `modelRequestPayload.ts` — builds the strongly typed request envelope (model, messages, tool definition) consumed by `modelRequest.ts` so tests and runtime code can reason about AI calls without ad-hoc casting.
- `planManager.ts` (emits `planManager.js`) — manages plan snapshots in-memory only, merges assistant updates, and emits plan progress events. All filesystem persistence has been removed. A dedicated controller now isolates state mutations, persistence hooks, and progress emission so the factory stays focused on wiring dependencies. The adapter handed to host integrations sanitizes inputs/outputs (cloning arrays, enforcing the shared `PlanStep` contract) so plugins can’t accidentally mutate the runtime copy.
- `planManagerController.ts` — encapsulates the plan state machine plus persistence adapter so callers receive a thin factory wrapper. It exposes focused methods (`update`, `sync`, `initialize`, `reset`) that commit mutations, emit progress, and guard invalid payloads through explicit helpers.
- `promptCoordinator.ts` (emits `promptCoordinator.js`) — routes prompt responses through a small state machine so buffering, waiter registration, and closure follow explicit transitions. Prompt requests emit a strongly typed `{ type: 'request-input', metadata: { scope } }` event so hosts can route approvals vs. general input without relying on loose records, and cancellations normalize ESC payloads before notifying waiters. Cancellation forwarding now relies on guarded optional chaining so the ESC state only triggers when waiters are present, keeping the public API linear.
- `promptCoordinatorState.ts` — deterministic queue state machine consumed by the prompt coordinator; ensures buffered values, waiters, and closed lifecycle remain in sync via explicit transitions.
- `promptMetadataNormalizer.ts` — coerces incoming prompt metadata into the canonical request shape (scope, tags, entries) so UI integrations can supply partial metadata without breaking the runtime contract.
- `responseParser.ts` and `responseValidator.ts` (emit their `.js` companions) — parse assistant JSON, normalize plan/command payloads, and enforce schema plus semantic validations for the OpenAgent tool response. The AI SDK `generateObject()` is configured with a provider-agnostic JSON Schema wrapper, while runtime validation uses the same JSON Schema via AJV. The `responseValidator.ts` surface re-exports helpers from `responseValidation/`, where AJV wiring, schema error formatting, and plan semantics live in smaller typed modules. The Zod schema remains for developer ergonomics but is not used at runtime; consumers import the canonical contracts directly.
- `historyEntry.ts`, `historyMessageBuilder.ts`, and `historyCompactor.ts` — previously migrated helpers that the runtime still imports via their compiled `.js` outputs. The history entry helper now proxies `role`/`content` through the payload to keep serialized history lean, the compactor consumes the shared contracts to build summarization prompts without `Record` escapes (and now isolates compaction heuristics behind a planning helper while delegating prompt formatting to `historyCompactorHelpers.ts` so the public API stays linear), and `historyMessageBuilder.ts` exposes discriminated observation payloads/summary helpers so plan updates, command output, and validation failures all serialize with explicit metadata for the LLM.

## Positive Signals

- Extensive unit coverage ensures protocol parsing/validation logic stays aligned with prompts.
- Plan management is transient; no on-disk persistence. Optional plan merging remains, while execution-time status changes stay in memory until the next assistant response.
- Approval flow separates policy (`services/commandApprovalService.js`) from human interaction logic.
- Tests now rely on dependency injection to stub the OpenAI client, so local runs do not require a real API key.
- Lint now runs clean across the runtime: observation building, OpenAI request orchestration, the pass executor, plan manager, and response validator share explicit types and error guards instead of `any` fallbacks.
- The OpenAI request wrapper now leans on the AI SDK response types so cancellation paths and completion payloads are validated at compile time.

## Risks / Gaps

- Runtime complexity is high; when modifying event shapes ensure CLI (`packages/cli/src`) and WebSocket bindings stay in sync.
- History compaction relies on model token limits; verify assumptions when changing default model or context window.
- Error surfaces lean on console warnings; consider structured logging for external integrations.

## Maintenance Notes (2025-10-13)

- Pass executor helpers were split into `executionContext`, `prePassSequence`, `responseResolution`, and `planExecutor` modules to keep the orchestration under 50 lines while retaining targeted unit tests for each path.
- Updated `passExecutor/planReminderController.ts` to call tracker methods on the tracker object (no destructuring) so `this` remains bound for stateful implementations. This resolves a failing test where a custom tracker used `this.count` internally.
- Factory initialization for the plan manager, prompt coordinator, and approval manager now flows through a shared helper that reports invalid factories before falling back to the default implementations.
- `loop.ts` now ships with strict TypeScript types (queues, factories, event observers) so downstream consumers receive typed runtime APIs without relying on `@ts-nocheck` escapes. The companion `loop.test.ts` was updated to use typed stub queues and prompt coordinators.
- `passExecutor.ts` now consolidates approval, execution safety, and plan snapshot helpers so the main loop reads linearly while emitting consistent status updates.
- Pass executor unit tests now rely on `passExecutor/__testUtils__/passExecutor.ts` helpers (stored outside `__tests__` so Jest does not collect them as suites), keeping the primary spec focused on behavior assertions instead of repeated mock wiring.
- `passExecutor/commandRuntime.ts` emits the active plan step snapshot alongside each `command-result` event so downstream UIs can display the parent step metadata with command output.
- `passExecutor.ts` explicitly treats human command rejections as a successful pass result, and the pass executor suite now includes a regression test to ensure the loop continues after vetoes.
- `passExecutor/planRuntime/` now hosts dedicated helpers (`stateMachine/`, `initialization.ts`, `finalization.ts`, `idleHandlers.ts`, `effects.ts`, `persistence.ts`, `persistenceCoordinator.ts`, `runtimeController.ts`, `observationRecorder.ts`, `reminderController.ts`) so `planRuntime.ts` delegates mutations, persistence, and reminder tracking to focused modules. The runtime methods now return discriminated-union results with explicit side-effect descriptors that callers commit via `applyPlanRuntimeEffects`, shrinking the core class dramatically.
- Persistence/plan state bridging helpers now live in `passExecutor/planRuntime/persistenceEffects.ts`, so initialization, idle-handling, and finalization modules compose persistence warnings/snapshots without hand-rolled duplication.
- Plan runtime now keeps completed steps in the active plan until the next assistant response (so the model can read the results), updates dependent `waitingForId` arrays, and no longer emits plan reminder auto-responses; downstream hosts should rely on the automatic executor instead of prompt nudges.
- Plan runtime now also tracks identifiers for steps that have been pruned so duplicate entries from later assistant responses are ignored while the rest of the plan continues executing.
- When the assistant sends an explicit empty plan (`[]`), the runtime clears the completed-step registry so identifiers can be reused after a full reset.
- Plan executor helpers share a centralized `planStatusTypes.ts` module for canonical status literals and normalization, eliminating duplicate union types across executor and utility layers.
- Runtime emitter accepts optional event identifier overrides so pass-scoped emitters can reuse stable IDs during streaming, keeping CLI keys consistent while partial updates arrive.
