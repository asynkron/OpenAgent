# Integration Tests Implementation

Added an integration-style test that runs the CLI in a child Node process and preloads a mock OpenAI implementation using Node's --require flag. This approach:

- Avoids modifying runtime logic or adding test-only exports.
- Mocks network/API behavior by intercepting require('openai') and returning a lightweight stub.
- Runs the agent as a child process and feeds stdin to simulate human input.

Files added:
- tests/mockOpenAI.js
- tests/agentLoop.integration.test.js

Notes:
- The test uses the agent's auto-approve CLI flag to skip interactive approvals. If you need to test approval prompts, consider a more involved pty-based test harness.
