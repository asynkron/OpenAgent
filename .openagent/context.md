# .openagent Context

Purpose
- Scratchpad and temporary artifacts used by OpenAgent (experiments, prototypes, sandboxes). Not production code, but kept in-repo for reproducibility and review.

Key directories
- temp/: short-lived or exploratory projects.

Known risks
- Temp assets can grow quickly if not curated. Prefer self-contained artifacts, avoid external downloads, and document whatâ€™s created.

Recent additions
- See below for current entries.
