Boulder Dash (CRT) â€” no-build, single-click retro game

Run
- Open index.html in a browser (no server required)
- Controls: Arrow keys or WASD to move, Space to wait, R to restart

Notes
- Procedural sprites avoid external assets.
- CRT effect uses CSS (scanlines, vignette, flicker) and small JS jitter.
- Physics: bottom-to-top sweep for falling/rolling. Exit opens when enough gems are collected.
